1.)A manufacturing process invovles configuring,setting up,and operating the machines invovled in the process.
   Once the machines are operating correctly and manufacturing systems are calibrated, they can run repeatedly to achieve high quality products.
   Process quality management and improvement can lead to a fewer defects in the software.however software development is a creative rather than a mechanical process,so the influence of 
   the individual skills and experience is key.

3.)They can find several faults in one pass without being concerned about interference between program faults. 
   They bring a number of people with different experience of different types of errors. Hence, the team approach offers greater coverage than any individual can bring. 
   The types of errors that inspections are unlikely to find are specification errors or errors that are based on a misunderstanding of the application domain (unless there are domain experts in the team). 

4.)Design metrics are inadequate because they assume that quality is only related to what can actually be measured.
   Also, it is difficult to make direct measurements of many of the software quality attributes

5.)The basic difficulty arises because the external attributes such as maintainability are not just dependent on a small number of internal product attributes. 
While the complexity of a system influences its maintainability, other issues such as the use of variable names, the system documentation and, particularly,
 the skills of the people doing the maintenance have such a large effect on the process that they may mask any maintainability differences arising from different levels of complexity. 
This does not contradict experiments where a relationship between maintainability and complexity was discovered – however, we don’t have enough evidence at the moment to generalize this.
