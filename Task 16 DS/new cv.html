  <li> My name is Jared Valensky.I am 20 years old. I currently have no work experience with software engineering and am willing to learn.Some of my passions are playing games,going outside and going for hikes or run.
      I also enjoy coding and love how interesting it can be to find new solutions to problems. Some things that motivate me are solving problems that have to do with code.I really enjoy software engineering and would be excited to 
	  work in the industry.
