Run k-means using 3 clusters on the 1953 and 2008 datasets separately.
What are the differences?

*For both algorithms I have used 3 clusters and 3 iterations

*Iterations 1-3 The cluster values differ between the years 1953 & 2008

*The number of countries in cluster 1 decreased from 1953 to 2008
 The number of countries in cluster 2 decreased from 1953 to 2008
 The number of countries in cluster 3 increase from 1953 to 2008

*Avg. birth rate in cluster 1 decreased from 1953 to 2008
 Avg. birth rate in cluster 2 increase from 1953 to 2008
 Avg. birth rate in cluster 3 decreased from 1953 to 2008

*Life Expectancy in cluster 1 increased from 1953 to 2008
 Life Expectancy in cluster 2 decreased from 1953 to 2008
 Life Expectancy in cluster 3 increased from 1953 to 2008

*The number of countries in cluster 1 1953 are more than the number of countries in cluster 1 2008
 The number of countries in cluster 2 1953 are more than the number of countries in cluster 2 2008
 The number of countries in cluster 3 1953 are less than the number of countries in cluster 3 2008


Next, run the algorithm with 4 clusters on dataBoth.csv

*Cluster 0 only consists of 2008 data where clusters 1, 2 and 3 consists of data from both 1953 and 2008

*(2008)South Africa & (1953)United States are both located in cluster 3

Are there any 2008 countries that are in a cluster that is made up mostly of 1953 countries? Try and explain why
*Yes, Cluster 1
*The countries in cluster 1 are the data points closest to that centroid

Are there any 1953 countries that are in a cluster that is made up of mostly 2008 countries? Try and explain why in your text file
*No there are not. With running this algorithm and the spread of the data, there are no data point for 1953 close to cluster 0 that is made up from data point of 2008
