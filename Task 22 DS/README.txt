K-Means Algorithm using Python
====================================================================================================

User specifies the number of clusters
User specifies the max. number of iterations

The program reads the relevant data for .csv files and run the k-means algorithm on the read data.

In this example the dataset consists of a list of countries and shows each country's birthrate 
per 1000 and life expectancy in 2008

After running the algorithm, the results are printed as follows:
    1. Number of countries belonging to each cluster
    2. Mean life expectancy and birth rate of each cluster
    3. List of countries belonging to each cluster

After each iteration the program outputs the value of the objective functions for the user to watch
the function converge
