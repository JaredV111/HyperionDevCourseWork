1.) Normalization is a process of evaluationg and correcting a table structure to minimise data redundancies and therefore reduce the likelihood 
    of data anomalies.
2.) To make a table in NF1 you need to eliminate repeating groups by eliminating the nulls by making sure that each repeating group attribute contains 
    an appropriate data value.This converts the table to NF1.
3.) A relation is in second normal form if it is in 1NF and every non key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the primary key.

4.)It is in the Second Normal form and, it doesn't have Transitive Dependency.
